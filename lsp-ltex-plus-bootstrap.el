;;
;; Lightweight bootstrap for lsp-ltex-plus.  This file is the only part of the
;; package that needs to be loaded at Emacs startup.  It defines the default
;; major-mode → language-ID alist and two autoloaded entry points that let the
;; full lsp-ltex-plus package load lazily — only when the user first opens a
;; file whose major mode is in the list.
;;
;; Users normally do not load this file directly; it is pulled in
;; automatically when `lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes' is called from the
;; `:init' block of `use-package'.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

;; lsp-ltex-plus-mode is defined in lsp-ltex-plus.el, which loads lazily.
;; This declaration silences the byte-compiler without creating a load-time dependency.
(declare-function lsp-ltex-plus-mode "lsp-ltex-plus")


;; This variable is defined here, in the bootstrap file, rather than in the main
;; `lsp-ltex-plus.el', so that it is available at Emacs startup without loading
;; the full package.  `lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes' reads this list at `:init'
;; time to compute the effective set of enabled modes and install a single
;; dispatcher on `after-change-major-mode-hook'; that dispatcher is what
;; triggers the lazy load of `lsp-ltex-plus.el' — only when the user first
;; opens a buffer whose exact `major-mode' is in the enabled set.
;; If the list lived in `lsp-ltex-plus.el', calling `lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes'
;; would force the entire package to load immediately, defeating deferred loading.
;;
;; By design, the list ships pre-populated with 80+ entries.  Many similar
;; packages ask the user to opt in to each major mode individually, but that
;; would be an unreasonable burden for a grammar checker that is useful across
;; virtually every language.  The default covers all commonly used modes; users
;; who want a narrower set can pass `:restrict-to' or `:exclude' to
;; `lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes' without touching this variable at all.
(defvar lsp-ltex-plus-major-modes
  ;; Each entry is (MAJOR-MODE LANGUAGE-ID PROGRAMMING-P).
  ;; PROGRAMMING-P is nil for markup/writing languages (checked by default)
  ;; and t for programming languages (opt-in via
  ;; `lsp-ltex-plus-check-programming-languages').
  ;;
  ;; The entries are data: a mode the running Emacs does not have -- a
  ;; third-party mode that is not installed -- is a symbol nothing ever
  ;; matches, and costs nothing.  The tree-sitter modes Emacs 29.1 ships
  ;; are listed like any other; the modes that arrived with 30.1 and 31.1
  ;; (`lua-mode' among them, third-party until then) are added below
  ;; behind `fboundp', not because the table needs it but because
  ;; `package-lint' asks for a guard on any symbol newer than the declared
  ;; Emacs floor.

  MAJOR-MODE    — Emacs major mode symbol.
  LANGUAGE-ID   — VS Code language identifier string, used in the LSP wire
                  protocol and by LTeX+ to select grammar rules.  The

Consulted at runtime by `lsp-ltex-plus--maybe-activate' (attached to
`after-change-major-mode-hook') to decide whether to turn on
`lsp-ltex-plus-mode' in the current buffer.  Matching is strict — only an
exact `eq' match against `major-mode' activates the client, so parent-mode

activation into buffers the user did not select.")

Buffers without a file name are activated only when

default; set it to nil to filter out transient buffers created by other
modes (e.g., markdown-mode's syntax-highlighting helpers that spawn
buffers in `python-ts-mode').  The variable lives in the lazily-loaded
full package, so it is read with `bound-and-true-p' to avoid forcing
that load from the dispatcher."

  "Enable `lsp-ltex-plus-mode' in the selected major modes.

Installs a single dispatcher on `after-change-major-mode-hook' that activates
the client in any buffer whose `major-mode' exactly matches one of the
selected modes.  Exact matching means parent-mode relationships do not cause
spurious activations: excluding `org-mode' keeps the client out of org
buffers even though `org-mode' derives from `text-mode'.

With no arguments, every major mode listed in `lsp-ltex-plus-major-modes\\='
is enabled.

The effective set of modes is built in three steps:

1. RESTRICT-TO — whitelist.  If non-nil, must be a list of major-mode symbols.
   Only modes present in both RESTRICT-TO and `lsp-ltex-plus-major-modes\\='
   are considered; any symbol not found in the alist is silently skipped.
   Omit this keyword to start from the full default list.

   (lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes
     :restrict-to \\='(org-mode markdown-mode latex-mode LaTeX-mode))

2. EXCLUDE — blacklist.  If non-nil, must be a list of major-mode symbols.
   Those modes are removed from the list produced by step 1.  Use this to
   drop a few unwanted modes from the large default list without having to
   enumerate all the ones you do want:

   (lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes
     :exclude \\='(python-mode c-mode c++-mode))

3. EXTEND-TO — additions.  If non-nil, must be a list of
   (MAJOR-MODE LANGUAGE-ID PROGRAMMING-P) entries following the same format
   as `lsp-ltex-plus-major-modes\\='.  These entries are appended after steps
   1 and 2, so they are never excluded.  Use this to enable modes that are
   absent from the built-in list:

   (lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes
     :extend-to \\='((my-custom-mode \"plaintext\" nil)))

All three keywords may be combined:

  (lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes
    :restrict-to \\='(org-mode markdown-mode)
    :exclude     \\='(markdown-mode)       ; hypothetical, for illustration
    :extend-to   \\='((my-custom-mode \"plaintext\" nil)))

The full lsp-ltex-plus package is loaded lazily — only when a selected major
mode is first activated in some buffer.

Because `lsp-ltex-plus-major-modes\\=' is read at call time, any direct
modification of that variable must happen BEFORE this function is called.
Since it is a plain `defvar\\=' (not a `defcustom\\='), use `setq\\=' before
the `use-package\\=' block:

  (setq lsp-ltex-plus-major-modes
        \\='((markdown-mode \"markdown\" nil)
          (org-mode      \"org\"      nil)))

  (use-package lsp-ltex-plus
    :defer t
    :init
    (lsp-ltex-plus-enable-for-modes))

In most cases the keyword arguments above are sufficient and direct
modification of `lsp-ltex-plus-major-modes\\=' is not needed.

Calling this function again replaces the enabled set; the dispatcher itself
is installed only once."

;;;; -- Directory-local safety -------------------------------------------------

;; These declarations live here, not on the defcustoms, because Emacs reads a
;; project's `.dir-locals.el' when it visits a file, before
;; `after-change-major-mode-hook' runs the dispatcher that loads the full
;; package.  A `:safe' on a defcustom in `lsp-ltex-plus-settings.el' does not
;; exist yet at that moment, so Emacs asked about every value the package
;; vouches for in the first file of the session.
;;
;; Directory-local safety, modelled on AUCTeX (and on Emacs core, which declares
;; `fill-column' safe for an integer and `indent-tabs-mode' for a boolean).  The
;; package vouches for a setting with a predicate rather than leaving every
;; user to answer the same question in every project:
;;
;;   - Settings that can only change how text is checked are declared safe on a
;;     type check alone.  The worst a `.dir-locals.el' can do with them is check
;;     in the wrong language, or accept a word you did not choose.
;;   - Settings naming a file this package *writes* are held to more than a type
;;     check: see `lsp-ltex-plus--project-file-safe-p', which follows AUCTeX's
;;     `TeX--output-dir-safe-p' in accepting only a name that cannot lead
;;     outside the tree its `.dir-locals.el' governs.
;;   - Four live settings are deliberately left unvouched for, so that Emacs
;;     asks before a repository you cloned can set them.  Do not "complete"
;;     the set by adding them to `lsp-ltex-plus--safe-variables':
;;
;;     The line is drawn at security threats, not at configurations a user
;;     might find surprising -- those are the user's responsibility.  So the
;;     LanguageTool credentials are vouched for (a `.dir-locals.el' can only
;;     set a variable, never read one, so a repository cannot learn a key
;;     this way; substituting its own is visible in its own file), and so is
;;     the n-gram model directory, whose worst case is that its extra rules
;;     do not work.
;;
;;     `lsp-ltex-plus-lt-server-uri' is the middle case: it names the host
;;     every document you edit is sent to, so it is vouched for by an
;;     allowlist of destinations rather than by a type check.  Unset and
;;     LanguageTool Premium pass; any other host still asks.  See
;;     `lsp-ltex-plus--lt-server-uri-safe-p'.
;;
;;     Settings read only at server start or at client setup are not in the
;;     table either — not because they are dangerous, but because a
;;     project-local value would silently do nothing, and vouching for it
;;     would imply otherwise.
