;;; Commentary:

;; Every setting this client reads per document is declared safe in
;; `lsp-ltex-plus--safe-variables', so a project's `.dir-locals.el' applies
;; without a prompt.  The policy behind
;; those declarations is the thing worth pinning down, because it is a
;; judgement rather than a mechanism, and both directions of drift are
;; easy and quiet:
;;
;;   * A predicate loosened to `stringp' stops asking about something that
;;     should ask.  Two settings are qualified rather than type-checked --
;;     the LanguageTool endpoint, which names the host documents are sent
;;     to, and the four project file paths, which this package writes to.
;;
;;   * A predicate added where a type check was enough starts asking about
;;     something harmless, once per project per session.  The line is
;;     security threats, not configurations a user might regret; the
;;     credentials and the n-gram model directory are on the near side of
;;     it and the reasons are recorded in the source.
;;
;; The list of settings at the bottom is the other half: a new
;; project-scopable defcustom that is missing from the table works
;; perfectly for its author and prompts everyone else.
