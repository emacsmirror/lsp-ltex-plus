;;; Commentary:

;; The doctor is a buffer the package checks like any other, so most of
;; what it does is already covered elsewhere.  What is asserted here is
;; what is particular to it: that the report is disabled and the samples
;; are not, that a finding is counted against the section it lands in
;; and no other, and -- the point of the whole design -- that a section
;; with nothing in it never reads as a section with nothing wrong.
;;
;; The real server is not needed for any of that; the one test that
;; wants a document opened uses the fake.
